>>> **We all take time to heal  
forget what we can't appeal  
regret what we don't feel  
indulge in a world we find real  
go deep within and break the seal  
a mask is no true shield  
we find doom from the weapons we wield  
find solace in a moonlit field  
find solace by a rushing river  
the morning dew, a soft wind shiver  
the moment before a kiss, warm lips quiver  
the stars endless when the moon's a sliver  
warm rain among waterfall mist  
the sunset and clouds, a vivid tryst  
the feeling of gazing into an abyss  
the playful magnetism that fuels each kiss  
engaging dreams before a shift  
porous pain fostered by a rift  
small hands find sands to sift  
seeking colorful seashells to gift  
can we let go of the things we believe?  
create a world, when we're ready we'll leave  
find beauty in all we perceive  
let go of what we used to conceal  
interactions fateful and real  
gratitude for all we can feel  
after all, we take time to heal**
